      <h1>What is the Car Living Quickstart Guide?</h1>
      <p> The Car Living Quickstart Guide is a static website for vehicle living information. Its main feature is the guide, located in the left sidebar. It contains the basic information someone needs to begin living in a vehicle, and exists to serve as a brief and comprehensive introduction to vehicle living, with an emphasis on short-term necessities and long-term living essentials. It is organized into sections, and you can find short descriptions of each section on the “Guide Organization” page. In addition to the guide, we document links to outside sources that we and our users find helpful on the “Community Resources” page. Users can find more specific information linked there, such as local laws and in-depth guides on building out a vehicle.</p>
      
      <h1>Who is it for?</h1>
      <p>We are a group of Informatics students at the University of Washington. The Car Living Quickstart Guide is our final project for the INFO 200 class, where we were tasked with creating an information resource which helps a group of people who have been historically underserved by technology. Our primary target audience is people who have recently undergone a crisis, and with little notice and no other options, have began living in their vehicles. However, as our resource covers several common introductory topics regarding vehicle-living, it may contain useful information for any individual interested in living in their vehicles, crisis or not. However, ultimately, our goal with this website was to create a resource that can be used in an emergency to learn the essential skills needed to live in a vehicle. Thus, the guide does not contain much information on more complex “vehicle camping” subjects, such as electrical wiring, plumbing, soundproofing, etc. Good luck!</p>
