         <h1>Interior Layout and Utilities</h1>
         <p>Everyone will end up in a different vehicle depending on their preferences, and in many cases you may not even get to decide. However, there are some common tips that everyone should follow, regardless of the vehicle you end up in. This section will cover how to set up your vehicle for comfortable residence and items you should consider using for continuous vehicle living.</p>
         
         <h2>Overview</h2>

            </ul>
         </h4>
         <h2 id="1">Climate Control</h2>
         <p>Keeping the climate of your vehicle comfortable is essential to vehicle living success. The most important things to consider are the temperature and humidity of your vehicle. Lowering the temperature to a manageable level in the summer months is perhaps the most difficult part of car living, so you may want to consider travelling to a cooler climate. If that is not a realistic option, a good air conditioning system is a must. Reflective covering should be a consideration for especially sunny environments. Lining your vehicle with reflective covering and an “air gap” in between can keep out radiant heat from the sun and allow your vehicle to stay cooler for longer. However, understand that this is not a replacement for air conditioning. In most cases, insulation is not very effective. If your environment is very cold or very hot, invest in a more expensive heater or air conditioning system instead. Make sure these systems have proper ventilation. If you decide to use additional air conditioning or heating you may need an additional source of power. See the Electricity/Maintenance section below for more information.</p>
         <p>Humidity is a tricky thing to deal with. The key for humidity (and to some extent temperature control) is to have good ventilation in your car. At the very least, make sure to crack your windows a bit to prevent moisture from building up. Cold water can freeze and cause damage to your vehicle, whereas warm water allows mold to grow. If you plan to live in an area with a more inhospitable environment, you may want to consider getting a roof fan and building a ventilation system. This article covers things you can do if you have a lot of resources to work with. It also has a lot of information about how humidity in a vehicle works in general. </p>
         <p>Another must-have is a carbon monoxide detector. Since you will be in close contact with a combustion engine at all times, you need to make sure you are protected. Be very careful about using products like non-vented heaters. Again, ventilation is key to avoiding these problems.</p>
         
         <h2 id="2">Comfort and Sleep</h2>
         <p>The most important part of keeping your vehicle comfortable is your sleeping area. Sleeping does not have to be complicated- if you are pressed for money it might make sense to just recline the passenger's seat and get some blankets. But at the very least, make sure to sleep in a car location separate from where you spend most of your day. In many situations, it may be worth pushing down or completely removing some seats to make room for a full-length mattress. In this case, you will want to install a wood platform to put your mattress on so that you can sleep on a flat surface. A foam mattress is usually better than an air mattress: although it is more expensive, it will not pop or deflate, and you can customize it by cutting it down to size. In some situations, you may want to consider stacking two cuts of a large mattress on top of each other. Be sure to leave enough space for yourself to get a good night’s rest!</p>
         <p>You will want your sleeping area to be set up so that you will not have to leave your car upon arriving at your sleeping location. This will allow you to be more discrete. If you will be sleeping in a more populated location, a sleeping mask and earplugs are both recommended. </p>
         
         <h2 id="3">Electricity and Maintenance</h2>
         <p>You may choose to install an electrical system in your car, or you might not. However, one absolute MUST is a spare battery in your car, along with jumper cables. Car batteries short out all the time, and you don’t want to be caught unprepared when that happens. Tires and brake pads are also good to keep in mind when it comes to checking for repairs.</p>
         <p>An electrical system in your vehicle can improve your climate control abilities, and it can also allow you to keep larger appliances like refrigerators or ovens. If you plan on installing an electrical system in your vehicle, be sure you know what you are doing before trying anything, as electricity is a tricky thing to get right. This guide is a good way to get started on vehicle electricity. </p>
         
         <h2 id="4">Presentation and Waste</h2>
         <p>It is important for your vehicle to be presentable. Avoiding a cluttered appearance will do wonders for your mental health in the long term and having a car that does not appear “lived in” shields you from unwanted attention- both from strangers and law enforcement on the lookout. At the very least, you should buy some sunshades or curtains to protect yourself from prying eyes. Keep your valuables secured and out of sight. <p>
         <p>One important thing to consider is your vehicle’s internal organization scheme. Disposable shopping bags work well for storing trash. You will need somewhere to put that trash and somewhere to put your clothes / anything else that you don’t use on a daily basis. Make sure those places are out of the way but still pretty easy to access. Under your bed or in the trunk are possible places for this. Get rid of your trash regularly, and try not to produce too much trash in the first place. There are often available public trash cans, but make sure not to dump your trash in someone’s private dumpster! This is against the law. </p>
         <p>The bottom line is that you do not want your vehicle to attract attention. If your vehicle starts growing mold or smelling terrible, do something about it! Don’t wait for the problem to force you to deal with it. </p>
