         <h1>Food, Sleep, and Hygiene</h1>
         <p>This page outlines topics such as food, sleep, and hygiene that are commonly associated with everyday issues vehicle livers often experience. Each topic includes essential information for an inexperienced vehicle liver in order to succeed. </p>
         
         <h2>Overview</h2>
         <h4>
            <ul>
            <li><a href="#1">Food</a></li>
            <li><a href="#2">Sleep</a></li>
            <li><a href="#3">Hygiene</a></li>
            </ul>
         </h4>
         <h2 id="1">Food</h2>
         <p>The purpose of living in one's vehicle could be to save money. A consistent and reliable food supply is essential. However, food can be extremely expensive and hard to keep fresh in a traveling lifestyle. There are many fast food options available that are cheap and easy. However, many people prefer to eat healthy in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle and prevent health issues that may cause excess healthcare payments in the future. Refrigeration is important to consider. Investing in a refrigerator for your vehicle means you can store vegetables, meat, dairy products, etc. It means you can save money by cooking in your van, all while eating healthy fresh foods instead of processed meals. Coolers are commonly used options to preserve food. This option saves an initial large payment one would make with a fridge. A cooler is small and convenient. However, one huge negative is the fact that you must consistently refill it with ice. It’s not the most reliable option, and could cost you more long-term. Quick and easy food options are also important to have on hand when living an on-the-go lifestyle. The following are some good examples: canned food, sandwitches, protein bars, nuts/chips/snack foods. Some things to consider include eating out can be the most convenient option to get a meal. However, the costs add up and you will most likely fall into an unhealthy lifestyle. Homeless shelters are a great option for vehicle livers. Many homeless shelters give away free food to people without homes. </p>
         
         <h2 id="2">Sleep</h2>
         <p>Sleep is extremely important to any person, especially one that is constantly traveling. Living in a vehicle can cause some concerns in terms of sleeping arrangements in one's own car, finding safe places to sleep, and the difficulties that come with that. There are some quick and easy options for a person on a budget and/or has a time constraint. In order to create a set up, you can consider folding down or removing seats of a vehicle. If the vehicle is small, consider reclining the passenger seat all the way down and adding a mattress pad/sleeping bag combination. Utilizing an inflatable mattress or a regular old mattress are easy and fairly comfortable ways of sleeping. Also, consider tinting windows for privacy at night. If you don’t have dark tint, you can put dark towels up in front of all windows. Another option for more long term vehicle living includes creating a custom build-out set up. This option, however, can take a significant amount of time and can be extremely costly. Some specific things to consider with this option include weight distribution of the things in the vehicle as well as making sure to maximize your space and function of set up.</p>
         
         <h2 id="3">Hygiene</h2>
         <p>Hygiene and finding affordable bathrooms can be a challenge for vehicle livers. There are many obvious places to use restrooms such as in public establishments. Many places do not demand people buy things in order to use their restrooms. However, showering is an issue many people are concerned with when considering vehicle living The following are some restroom options that you may not have considered: If you’re on the road with and there is no bathroom in site, consider using an emergency pee bottle. Many use their plastic well-sealing water bottles to prevent smell. However, any container will do. For convenience and cleanliness, consider using a funnel with this option. This option goes hand in hand with a poop shovel. Showering is a more difficult issue. Some affordable shower options include: getting a gym pass/community centers (YMCA is a free option), road showers, public beaches/ campgrounds, truck stops, portable showers ( tank that let you shower anywhere – just fill up the tank and turn it on), solar shower (a bag of water that you leave out in the sun until it heats up, then you can hang it from a high place and shower using the attached nozzle). When you’re desperate -- use baby wipes!</p>
