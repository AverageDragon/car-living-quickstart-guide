         <h1>Guide Organization</h1>
         <h3>1. Food, Sleep, and Hygiene</h3>
         <p>This page outlines topics such as food, sleep, and hygiene that are commonly associated with everyday issues vehicle livers often experience. Each topic includes essential information for an inexperienced vehicle liver in order to succeed. </p>
         
         <h3>2. Privacy, Security, and Parking</h3>
         <p>Not only is knowledge of food and hygiene, vehicle environment, legal logistics integral to keeping your vehicle living life afloat, there remains much to be said regarding parking habits, self and car defense, and what to do in potentially life-threatening situations. This section will cover how to navigate these complex situations revolving around parking, privacy, and security.</p>
         
         <h3>3. Interior Layout and Utilities</h3>
         <p>Everyone will end up in a different vehicle depending on their preferences, and in many cases you may not even get to decide. However, there are some common tips that everyone should follow, regardless of the vehicle you end up in. This section will cover how to set up your vehicle for comfortable residence and items you should consider using for continuous vehicle living.</p>
         
         <h3>4. Jobs, Insurance, and Addresses</h3>
         <p>If you are going to be living in a vehicle without any form of primary residence, there are several issues which need to be settled. Much of the United States relies on permanent addresses, for issues such as employment, receiving mail, and filling out tax information. Auto insurance also becomes more important, as your vehicle is now your home. These obstacles compound the difficulty of applying to jobs, which we will also explore in this section. As laws vary between different states, not all information in this guide may be accurate to your particular location. Make sure to check your areaâ€™s requirements so you can find information that is right for you. </p>
         
         <h1>Other Site Resources</h1>
         
         <h3>Community Resources</h3>
         <p>A curated table containing links to resources that may be helpful to someone who is living in a vehicle. The resources are submitted by the community, checked by administrators for authenticity, then added under the appropriate categories.</p>
         
         <h3>Feedback Form</h3>
         <p>A user submission form that can answer your questions or help us improve the website. Feedback helps us improve this resource over time, and incorporate other features which help our mission.</p>
         
         <h3>Discussion Forums</h3>
         <p>A link to the Reddit VanDwellers community. These forums are dedicated to living in vehicles, allow beginners to ask questions and get help, and they have indexed numerous valuable vehicle-living resources.</p>
