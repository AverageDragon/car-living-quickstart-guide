         <h1>Privacy, Security and Parking</h1>
         <p>Not only is knowledge of food and hygiene, vehicle environment, legal logistics integral to keeping your vehicle living life afloat, there remains much to be said regarding parking habits, self and car defense, and what to do in potentially life-threatening situations. This section will cover how to navigate these complex situations revolving around parking, privacy, and security.</p>
         
         <h2>Overview</h2>
         <h4>

            <li><a href="#1">Parking - Know the area or location you’re parked in</a></li>

         </h4>
         <h2 id="1"></h2>
         <p>Before being able to plan any courses of action for car living, you need a safe, private, and secure place to think of your next steps. What comes first is research about potential areas to park for an extended period of time. In the big picture, think about the city or neighborhoods around you, are there higher or lower rates of crime that you can find online, especially of vehicular crime in the area? Is the area vulnerable to disastrous weather conditions like floods, high-winds/tornados, wildfires (see here for cities to potentially avoid? There are also many cities or neighborhoods that offer safe parking programs, which is definitely one thing to research when finding where to park.</p>
         <p>Once a city or neighborhood is considered, it’s also important to think about where in the city or neighborhood has three things:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>A well-lit area</li>
            <li>Proximity to resources for food and water, hygiene</li>
            <li>A secure surrounding (balance between privacy and security)</li>
         </ol>
         <p>For a secure surrounding in specific, this includes possible exit routes, difficulty of navigation, and proximity to “sketchy” buildings or areas.</p>
         <p>What’s also important for parking is to keep watch of how you may be viewed from the outside. This includes watching for parking signs and potential tips from your car’s parking location for cops or others to confront you. This guide will give a list of some places you can find around you to park. Some other pieces of advice include being aware at all times when you are parked, backing into parking spaces for easier and swift exits, and avoiding areas where camera surveillance can see you and your car.</p>
         
         <h2 id="2">Privacy - Always be situationally aware of your surroundings</h2>
         <p>Privacy when car-living is without a doubt very underrated in terms of its importance to living in peace securely. To start, as previously mentioned in the section above, be sure to park in a place where there is a balance between security and privacy. On a smaller scale, the only parts to this section is maintaining privacy for yourself and your car.</p>
         <p>When we talk about maintaining privacy for yourself, this includes the habits or actions you may take to better privatize your vehicle. If your car-living vehicle requires setup or disassembling, it’s in your best interest to do so without anyone seeing, whether this be cameras or a person. So, to maintain privacy in this respect, you’d plan to park or do certain activities for your car maintenance around times you’d think are safe to do so. Another thing is to not attract attention to your vehicle, so this includes thinking about your actions from the perspective of someone who could see your vehicle from the outside, and what they can infer based on your habits. This video goes into detail about some of these habits. One very specific case for pet owners is working around your pets potential privacy-compromising traits, especially for dogs.</p>
         <p>For your car, it’s important to bring up the need to make your vehicle not attract any unwarranted attention. What this many look like is your car’s physical appearance (paint, windows), and on the inside setting up curtains ways or other ways to redirect curious bystanders. This video contains ways to increase privacy for windows in particular.</p>
         
         <h2 id="3">Security - Take into consideration ways to defend yourself</h2>
         <p>This section reviews over security for yourself like habits and tactics as well as for your car like car modifications and habits. To start off, security for yourself looks like being attentive and aware of your home as it’s more public than a stationary home. Basic habits like locking your doors and locks being lockable from the inside, not leaving your belongings in sight, and ensuring you have privacy (information from earlier section) are often overlooked but crucial to your new living situation. What this really exemplifies is the need for privacy, as if you have many things in sight in a cramped space, you are definitely more likely to have your car be broken into. Be sure to read up guides like this for tips to protect your car and essentially home from being stolen. More secure habits would be like bringing your valuables anytime you leave your vehicle or keeping a safe in the car if you’re able, sending your sleeping/parking location to someone you trust, and having your keys always on you even in the vehicle.</p>
         <p>As a person, you can increase your chances of a secure living space if you yourself can defend your vehicle adequately. For skills you can acquire, knowing how to defend yourself in terms of fighting or escaping are useful to learn and can be done through research or taking self-defense courses. Another skill and is something mentioned throughout all these sections is having awareness about what’s happening and what can happen around you. You can also defend yourself well using firearms or other weapons.</p>
         <p>As for your car, it is understandable that there are many modifications that cannot be done in a short amount of time, but even smaller fixes like window films or covers can buy you time in hazardous situations. As for some bigger and expensive modifications, cameras or upgraded locks or windows can make your car a fortress. This is not to mention that the inside of your car needs security attention as well, as having first aid kits, a fire extinguisher and tools in case of unmitigated disasters can help you tenfold. </p>
