         <h1>Jobs, Insurance, and Addresses</h1>
         <p>This section is temporary, and contains copy-pasted content. It will be rewritten. If you are going to be living in a vehicle without any form of primary residence, there are several issues which need to be settled. Much of the United States relies on permanent addresses, for issues such as employment, receiving mail, and filling out tax information. There are several solutions to these problems, but as laws vary between different states, not all information in this guide may be accurate to your particular location.</p>
         
         <h2>Overview</h2>
         <h4>
            <ul>
            <li><a href="#1">Obtaining a Permanent Address</a></li>
            <li><a href="#2">Cheap Health Insurance, Car Insurance, and RV Insurance</a></li>
            <li><a href="#3">Finding a Job</a></li>
            </ul>
         </h4>
         <h2 id="1">Obtaining a Permanent Address</h2>
         <p>For individuals trying to apply for jobs, not having a physical address can be an immediate roadblock to getting a job interview. Even if you are living out of your car, you can obtain a physical address to meet your needs.</p>
         <p>You will need a place where you can receive correspondence. Mailbox services are available and affordable to allow you to receive mail from all essential entities, such as employers, doctors, and even insurance companies. The  United States Post Service (USPS)  is the most commonly noted provider to whom you to pay a small annual fee and obtain a dedicated mailbox and personal, verifiable address in the form of a post office (P.O.) box.</p>
         <p>This doesn’t suit all needs, since a mailing address is not necessarily the same as your residential address. Perhaps the most difficult challenge this presents is the issue of getting a driver’s license, which generally requires a residential address (or a physical address). Your best bet is to check with your local DMV, because each state has its own guidelines as to what’s acceptable and legal – and you want to always make sure you are following the law!</p>
         
         <h2 id="2">Cheap Health Insurance, Car Insurance, and RV Insurance</h2>
         <p>Auto insurance requires you to pay a monthly fee so that in the event of an accident or damage to your vehicle, all or a portion of the associated costs are covered by your policy. Not only does auto insurance offer financial protections, but auto insurance is also required by law in most states. Though tempting in the short-term, not getting your car covered by insurance is a bad idea in the long run, and will likely cost you more. As for health insurance, there are a few options.</p>
         <p>Look into Medicaid. If you are homeless due to a low-income status, you may be eligible for Medicaid, a jointly funded, Federal-State health insurance program for low-income Americans. You may qualify for Medicaid in your state if you meet specific income-based requirements.</p>
         <p>Regardless of state, the following situations will typically qualify an individual for Medicaid: low-income; pregnant women, infants, and children in low-income households; and living with a disability.</p>
         
         
         <h2 id="3">Finding a Job</h2>
         <p>Whether you are employed in a position with a salary that does not enable you to maintain the standard of living in your community, or you are temporarily unemployed and are looking to re-enter the labor market, applying for jobs will be a critical step in getting yourself back into a safe, secure home. Follow these steps to get out into the labor market and find a position that suits your skills and competencies.</p>
         <p>Present a clean, professional appearance. To be hired, you will need to be able to interview and arrive for work showered, shaved, with hair and teeth brushed. A clean appearance is not only a requirement of companies that want their employees to positively represent their brand, in some industries (such as the fast food service industry) it is a requirement of the Health Department to protect all workers and customers.</p>
         <p>Obtain a method of communication. When you apply for a job, any prospective employers will need to be able to communicate with you regularly, both during the interview process, and once you are hired.</p>
         <p>If you are homeless and unable to supply a landline, you will need to be prepared in advance with an alternate communication method.</p>
