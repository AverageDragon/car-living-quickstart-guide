         <h1>Jobs, Insurance, and Addresses</h1>
         <p>If you are going to be living in a vehicle without any form of primary residence, there are several issues which need to be settled. Much of the United States relies on permanent addresses, for issues such as employment, receiving mail, and filling out tax information. Auto insurance also becomes more important, as your vehicle is now your home. These obstacles compound the difficulty of applying to jobs, which we will also explore in this section. As laws vary between different states, not all information in this guide may be accurate to your particular location. Make sure to check your area’s requirements so you can find information that is right for you. </p>
         
         <h2>Overview</h2>
         <h4>
            <ul>
            <li><a href="#1">Obtaining a Permanent Address</a></li>
            <li><a href="#2">Cheap Health Insurance, Car Insurance, and RV Insurance</a></li>
            <li><a href="#3">Finding a Job</a></li>
            </ul>
         </h4>
         <h2 id="1">Obtaining a Permanent Address</h2>
         <p>Much of the United States operates under the assumption that everyone has a permanent address, and the job market is no exception. However, living in a vehicle does not mean you are forced to do without an address. The United States Post Service (USPS) allows you to pay a small annual fee in exchange for a dedicated mailbox and official address at a post office (P.O.) box. For people who live in their cars, setting up a P.O. box is essential as it gives you access to all kinds of services. </p>
         <p>However, a mailing address is not necessarily the same as your residential address. Getting a driver’s license is a big problem, since that generally requires a residential address (or a physical address). Your best bet is to check with your local DMV, because each state has its own guidelines as to what’s acceptable and legal – and you want to always make sure you are following the law! Consider using the address of a close relative. In addition, there are some private P.O. box services that may count as a physical address.</p>
         
         <h2 id="2">Cheap Health Insurance, Car Insurance, and RV Insurance</h2>
         <p>Auto insurance requires you to pay a monthly fee so that all or a portion of the associated costs will be paid for if your vehicle is damaged. Auto insurance offers financial security, and it is also required by law in most states. Not getting your car covered by insurance is a bad idea in the long run, and not paying for it will probably cost you more. RV insurance is often cheaper than ordinary vehicle insurance, but many insurance companies are very picky over what is considered an RV. Also, non-RV auto insurance requires you to have a permanent address (discussed above). This guide provides a quick overview of the types of vehicle insurance and how to purchase each one. </p>
         <p>Health insurance is also important-- you don’t want to be crushed by medical debt while on the road. If you do not have an employer-provided healthcare plan, consider these options:</p>
         <ul>
            <li><p><b>Look into Medicaid.</b> If you are homeless due to a low-income status, you may be eligible for Medicaid, a government insurance program for low-income Americans. You may qualify for Medicaid in your state if you meet specific income-based requirements.</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Regardless of state, the following situations will typically qualify an individual for Medicaid: low-income; pregnant women, infants, and children in low-income households; and living with a disability.</li>
                  <li>Medicaid can help provide homeless individuals access to such health care services as substance abuse counseling and rehabilitation, mental health care, and treatment for chronic diseases.</li>
                  <li>To apply for Medicaid in your home state, you must submit an application. Be prepared to provide documentation. The process of applying for Medicaid is lengthy and complicated. Consider working with a third-party to assist you with your application.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li><p><b>Look into subsidized health care coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace.</b> If you do not qualify for Medicaid, you may still meet income-based requirements to obtain cheaper coverage from the Health Insurance Marketplace. This will allow you to purchase a health care plan that fits your needs at an affordable cost based on your annual income. These offerings vary widely, so put in your information to see what works for you.</p></li>
         </ul>
         
         <h2 id="3">Finding a Job</h2>
         <p>Whether you have a job with a salary that does not enable you to maintain the standard of living in your area, or you are temporarily unemployed and are looking to re-enter the labor market, applying for a new job is necessary to get yourself back into a safe, secure home. Consider these steps when applying to any job.</p>
         <ul>
            <li><b>Present a clean, professional appearance.</b> To be hired, you will need to be able to interview and arrive for work showered, shaved, with hair and teeth brushed. Not only do most companies require cleanliness for their brand, but some industries (such as the fast food service industry) need cleanliness to meet Health Department standards.</li>
            <li><b>Seek medical treatment.</b> If a mental health challenge has been keeping you from maintaining stable employment, then make sure to obtain the help you need before moving forward. There are many public health services and low-cost or subsidized health insurance options available for those in need, which are partially covered above.</li>
            <li><b>Obtain a method of communication.</b> When you apply for a job, employers will need to be able to communicate with you both during the interview process and once you are hired. If you are homeless and do not have a phone, you will need to be prepared with an alternate communication method.
               <ul>
                  <li>If you have an email address, you may be able to access email regularly from a public library, an Internet café if one exists in your area or a homeless shelter.</li>
                  <li>If you have a friend, family member, or sponsor assisting you with getting back on your feet, you may be able to provide their phone number as long as they have a way of relaying messages to you.</li>
                  <li>You may also choose to buy a low-cost cell phone and plan so that you have a method of communicating with employers or prospective employers. Use this instead of a burner phone so you have a consistent number over time, because it might take some time before you hear back.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         
         <p>Another possibility for employment is <b>workamping</b>, which is when you work in exchange for a parking place. Workamping has become very popular in recent years and is now a very competitive job market. Some locations will give you a parking place, some will pay for your parking place costs, some will give you a parking place AND pay you a small wage. It's a good idea to keep in mind the usual hourly wage for the position vs. the actual parking price charged to the public to make sure you are not being underpaid.</p>
